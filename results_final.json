  "telecom_explanation": "This capacity is derived using slot-level statistical multiplexing analysis with percentile-based provisioning and buffer-aware congestion modeling to ensure <=1% slot loss compliance while minimizing over-dimensioning.",
  "cost_analysis_summary": "Peak-based dimensioning leads to significant capex waste. By using 99th percentile dimensioning, we avoid ~55.7% over-provisioning. Adding a modest 4-symbol buffer further reduces capacity requirements by absorbing micro-bursts."
